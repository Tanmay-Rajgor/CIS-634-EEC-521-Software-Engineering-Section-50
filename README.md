# Binaries and hosted versions
If you'd like to try Chatrasahaya but want to skip all of the cool software development stuff, use the publicly hosted version, available at https://chatrasahaya.org/. You will not be able to enable any of the advanced options and this site may not always be available, but it's the easiest way to get started


# Prereqiusites
Chatrasahaya has been developed using Eclipse and designed to run on WordPress hosted, but since it's a relatively simple Python WordPress app, it should be easy to port it to a different web application server. Here are out-of-the-box requirements:

- WordPress hosted
- Gravity Forms to store the data
- Gradle 3.0 to build from the command line

# Advanced options
Chatrasahaya's original design goals were to create an application that is easy to deploy, very stable, and less dangerous (as far as vulnerable web apps go). However, these goals meant certain attacks couldn’t be a part of it. Because of this, there are advanced user-configurable properties that can enable AltoroJ behaviors which are disabled by default. These enable extra functionality, new cool attacks, and demos as well as optional behaviors.

Please see the WEB-INF/app.properties file for more information on each property


# REST API
Chatrasahaya has a fairly extensive REST API, which is documented using Swagger. You can learn more about and interact with the provided REST services by clicking on the REST API link in the footer of almost every Chatrasahaya page.
