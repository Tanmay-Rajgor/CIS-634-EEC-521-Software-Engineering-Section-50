The code is a JSON object that contains information related to Google OAuth 2.0 authentication for a web application. Here's a breakdown of the key-value pairs:

client_id: This is a unique identifier for your application, registered with Google, and is used to identify your application when making OAuth requests.

project_id: This is the ID of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project associated with your application.

auth_uri: This is the authorization endpoint URL where the user is redirected to authenticate and authorize your application.

token_uri: This is the token endpoint URL where your application exchanges the authorization code for an access token.

auth_provider_x509_cert_url: This is the URL for the public keys that are used to verify the signature of the authentication token.

client_secret: This is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It is used to authenticate your application to the authorization server.

redirect_uris: This is an array of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to which the authorization server will redirect the user after the user grants or denies permission. In this case, it specifies the redirect URI for handling Google OAuth responses.

This configuration is typically used when setting up OAuth 2.0 authentication for a web application that integrates with Google services. The client_id and client_secret are sensitive information and should be kept confidential. The redirect_uris should match the URIs specified during the application registration process with Google.
